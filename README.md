# WNHL-Apple

This code was created by Sawyer Fenwick and Daniel Figueroa for completion of COSC 3P97 Mobile Computing Experiential Project.  

It has not been maintained by us since creation. Once it was on the App Store, it became property of the WNHL. What is currently on the App Store is being maintained by the WNHL.
