# WNHL-Apple

## Background

The iOS variant of the existing WNHL (Wednesday Night Hockey League) mobile app on Android devices which was an app designed for increased convenience at navigating the services of WNHL.
This developed at the request of the owners of the organization.

## Setup

You will need to set this up on Xcode. Afterwards, no additional libaries should be needed to be installed as no additional ones were used. As a result, after it is cloned onto Xcode, 
you should be able to build and then run the application on a simulated device. It can be done on your phone as well but this will involve the additional steps of setting your phone to "Developer Mode" and subsequently
'trusting' the developer. 

## How To Use

The app will initially take a moment on first instatiation as it fetches all the information from the database per the WNHL's data. Afterwards one can navigate via touch 
to the other parts of the app to see teams, statistics, settings and even the means to search. Since this app is mostly for purveying data, most features are limited
to just viewing the data and going back. However, certain features exist such as the location for games or donations which will take the user out of the app and into another.
